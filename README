TO RUN:

1. Type in "make" and hit enter
2a. "./main + keyboard input" to build / print tree with keyboard
2b. "./main < test.txt" to build / print tree with input from test.txt
2c. "./main test.txt" to build / print tree with input from test.txt

3. Type "make clean" to remove executables.  This will also remove log files.


NOTE: There is one small issue.  In your video explaining P0 you had an example starting with da and ending with ad.
      In my project ad will not be added to the tree because its lexical value is equivalent to the root node.  
      Also, it's not stored as a duplicate because the characters are in different order.  So it is left off.
      I tried to alter my rescursive insert function, but it would seg fault.  I wanted it to move left if it's equal
      but couldn't figure out how to do it the right way.  Other than that it works perfectly.

      Thanks for helping me and giving me extra time!
